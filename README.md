## Libraries used

- [**Realm**](https://realm.io/): **a mobile database, fast and easy to use.**  
Looking for all Clips that contain "Search Bubble" in its "description" field is as simple as  
```RealmResults<Clip> clips = realm.where(Clip.class).contains("description", "Search Bubble", true).findAll()```

- [**Dagger 2**](http://google.github.io/dagger/): **A fast dependency injector for Android and Java**  
Instead of creating a new Clip object yourself with ```Clip clip = new Clip();```  Dagger 2 makes it automatically from
